# Resume

This repository hosts the latest versions of my professional resume, along with the source code used to generate them.


## Available Versions

You can access the up-to-date PDF versions of my resume in the following languages:

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ [English Resume](latex-english/beck-joel_resume-english.pdf)
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª [German Resume](latex-german/beck-joel_resume-german.pdf)


## Background

Originally, I generated my resume using RMarkdown, specifically with [pagedown](https://pagedown.rbind.io). However, I've transitioned to using LaTeX for better customization and precision. The current LaTeX format is adapted from Jake Gutierrez's resume template, which can be found on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs).


## Contributing & Feedback

While this repository primarily serves as a host for my resume, feedback or suggestions for improvements are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue or send me a message if you have any thoughts.
